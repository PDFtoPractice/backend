<br></span></div><div ><span >What is an angioplasty operation?
<br></span><span >An angioplasty operation aims to open 
<br>blocked arteries around the heart. A doctor will 
<br>carefully guide a special instrument through an 
<br>artery (which is usually in the groin) to reduce 
<br>or remove the blockage.
<br>There are three types of angioplasty 
<br>operations where ReoPro can be used:
<br>• Using an in</span><span >ﬂ</span><span > atable balloon to compress an 
<br>artery blockage (balloon angioplasty)
<br>• Using a cutting device to open a blocked 
<br>artery (atherectomy)
<br>• Inserting an expandable metal sheath to 
<br>keep an artery open (stent)
<br></span></div><div ><span >2. </span><span >What you need to know before 
<br></span></div><div ><span >you are given ReoPro
<br></span></div><div ><span >Do not use ReoPro
<br></span><span >Your doctor will review your medical history to 
<br>see if you are at an increased risk for any side 
<br>e</span><span >ﬀ</span><span > ects associated with being given ReoPro.
<br>To prevent risks of increased bleeding ReoPro 
<br>must not be given:
<br>• if you have internal bleeding
<br>• if you have had a stroke within the last two 
<br>years
<br>• if you have had any head, spinal surgery 
<br>(or trauma) or other major surgery in the last 
<br>two months
<br>• if you have brain cancer
<br>• if you have serious bleeding problems or 
<br>have very low amounts of platelets in your 
<br>blood
<br>• if you have uncontrolled high blood pressure
<br>• if you have an abnormal bulge in one of your 
<br>blood vessels (aneurysm)
<br>• if you have serious problems with your liver
<br>• if you are on dialysis for kidney failure
<br>ReoPro must not be given if you are allergic 
<br>(hypersensitive):
<br>• to abciximab, to any of the other ingredients 
<br>of ReoPro or to a group of medicines known 
<br></span><span >as ‘murine monoclonal antibodies’.
<br>• to a protein called papain (or to papaya fruit 
<br>which contains papain). Papain is used in 
<br>the production of ReoPro and very small 
<br>amounts may be present.
<br>If you think that you </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > t into any of 
<br>the categories described above, it is important 
<br>that you discuss it with your doctor. ReoPro 
<br>must not be given in these situations.
<br></span><span >Warnings and precautions
<br></span><span >Talk to your doctor before using ReoPro
<br>• if you are taking blood-thinning medicines or 
<br>any other medicines that a</span><span >ﬀ</span><span > ect blood clotting 
<br>or blood platelets (see “Using other 
<br>medicines” section).
<br></span></div><div ><span >• if you have previously received ReoPro, 
<br>since this could be associated with higher 
<br>risk of reduction in blood platelets or allergic 
<br>reactions (hypersensitivity).
<br>• if you have serious problems with your 
<br>kidneys, since this may put you at risk of 
<br>increased bleeding. In this case, your doctor 
<br>might monitor your blood frequently.
<br>• if you are more than 65 years of age (see 
<br>“Adults over 65 years of age” section).
<br>If you think that you </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > t into any of the 
<br>categories described above, it is important 
<br>that you discuss it with your doctor.
<br></span><span >Adults over 65 years of age
<br></span><span >In patients who are over 65 years of age, 
<br>ReoPro should be given with caution, because 
<br>of risks of increased bleeding.
<br></span><span >Other medicines and ReoPro
<br></span><span >Tell your doctor if you have been given blood-
<br>thinning medicines, or any other medicines 
<br></span><span >that a</span><span >ﬀ</span><span > ect blood clotting (‘anticoagulants’) or 
<br>blood platelets (‘anti-platelet medicines’). It is 
<br>particularly important that you tell your doctor 
<br>if ‘thrombolytic’ medicines have been given to 
<br>unblock your arteries. Being given ReoPro 
<br>together with these medicines may put you at 
<br>risk of increased bleeding.
<br>Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently 
<br>taken  or might take any other medicines.
<br></span><span >Pregnancy and breast-feeding
<br></span><span >ReoPro should not be given during pregnancy 
<br>unless clearly necessary, since the e</span><span >ﬀ</span><span > ect of 
<br>ReoPro on pregnant women or unborn 
<br>children is not known.
<br>Breast-feeding must be stopped before being 
<br>given ReoPro, since it is not known whether 
<br>ReoPro is secreted in breast milk.
<br></span></div><div ><span >3. </span><span >How to use ReoPro
<br></span><span >Your nurse or doctor will inject ReoPro liquid 
<br>from a syringe into one of your veins. This is 
<br>known as a ‘bolus injection’.
<br>After you have had the injection, your nurse, 
<br>doctor or pharmacist will put more diluted 
<br>ReoPro liquid into a bag which is connected by 
<br>a tube to a needle which goes into one of your 
<br>veins. This is known as a ‘drip’ or ‘infusion’.
<br>Depending on your condition ReoPro will be 
<br>given to you as follows:
<br>• If you are about to undergo an angioplasty 
<br>operation, your doctor will give you the bolus 
<br>injection 10 to 60 minutes before the 
<br>operation begins. After the bolus injection 
<br>your doctor will start the infusion. 
<br>The infusion will continue for 
<br>12 hours after the 
<br>operation is 
<br></span><span >completed.

<br></span></div><div ><span >1. </span><span >What ReoPro is and what it is 
<br></span></div><div ><span >used for
<br></span></div><div ><span >What ReoPro is?
<br></span><span >The active ingredient, abciximab, is a ‘murine 
<br>monoclonal antibody’. Monoclonal antibodies 
<br>are proteins that recognise and bind to other 
<br>unique proteins. ReoPro belongs to a group 
<br>of medicines known as antithrombotics and 
<br>binds to proteins in your blood to help to 
<br>prevent blood clots.
<br></span><span >What is ReoPro used for?
<br></span><span >ReoPro is used when you undergo an 
<br>operation known as angioplasty (see “What 
<br>is an angioplasty operation?” below) for the 
<br>following purposes:
<br>• ReoPro is used (together with heparin and 
<br>acetylsalicylic acid) to prevent the formation 
<br>of blood clots in the heart during or after an 
<br>angioplasty operation.
<br>• ReoPro is also used (together with heparin 
<br>and acetylsalicylic acid) to lower the short 
<br>term risk of getting a heart attack before an 
<br>angioplasty operation, which is planned to 
<br>take place within the next 1-month. This is 
<br>for patients who have chest pain due to low 
<br>blood supply to the heart (unstable angina) 
<br>and have not responded to the usual therapy.
<br></span></div><div ><span >The following informa tion is intended for 
<br>healthcare professionals only:
<br></span><span >Instructions for use and handling
<br></span><span >1. Calculate the number of ReoPro vials 
<br></span></div><div ><span >needed. The recommended dose of ReoPro 
<br>is a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous bolus 
<br>immediately followed by a 0.125 </span><span >μ</span><span >g/kg/min 
<br>(to a maximum of 10 </span><span >μ</span><span >g/min) continuous 
<br>intravenous infusion.
<br></span></div><div ><span >2. Parenteral medicinal products should be 
<br>inspected visually for particulate matter prior 
<br>to administration. Preparations of ReoPro 
<br>containing visibly opaque particles should 
<br>NOT be used.
<br></span></div><div ><span >3. As with all parenteral medicinal products, 
<br>aseptic procedures should be used during 
<br>the administration of ReoPro.
<br></span></div><div ><span >4. Preparation of Bolus Injection: Withdraw the 
<br>necessary amount of ReoPro for the bolus 
<br>injection into a syringe. Filter the bolus 
<br>injection using a sterile non-pyrogenic, low 
<br></span><span >protein binding 0.2 / 0.22 </span><span >μ</span><span >m or 5.0 </span><span >μ</span><span >m 
<br>syringe </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > lter. The bolus should be 
<br>administered over one (1) minute.
<br></span></div><div ><span >5. Preparation of intravenous infusion: 
<br></span></div><div ><span >Withdraw the necessary amount of ReoPro 
<br>for the continuous infusion into a syringe. 
<br>Inject into an appropriate container of sterile 
<br>sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for 
<br>injection or 5% glucose solution and infuse 
<br>at the calculated rate via a continuous 
<br>infusion pump. The continuous infusion 
<br>should be </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > ltered either upon admixture 
<br>using a sterile, non-pyrogenic low protein 
<br>binding 0.2 / 0.22 </span><span >μ</span><span >m or 5.0 </span><span >μ</span><span >m syringe </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > lter 
<br>or upon administration using an in-line, 
<br>sterile, non-pyrogenic, low protein-binding 
<br>0.2 </span><span >μ</span><span >m or 0.22 </span><span >μ</span><span >m </span><span >ﬁ</span><span > lter. Discard the unused 
<br>portion at the end of the infusion period.
<br></span></div><div ><span >6. No incompatibilities have been shown with 
<br></span></div><div ><span >intravenous infusion </span><span >ﬂ</span><span > uids or commonly 
<br>used cardiovascular medicinal products. 
<br>Nevertheless, it is recommended that 
<br>ReoPro be administered in a separate 
<br></span><span >intravenous line whenever possible and not 
<br></span><span >mixed with other medicinal products.
<br></span></div><div ><span >7. No incompatibilities have been observed 
<br></span></div><div ><span >with glass bottles or polyvinyl chloride bags 
<br>or administration sets.
<br></span></div><div ><span >8. Any unused medicinal product or waste 
<br></span></div><div ><span >material should be disposed of in 
<br>accordance with local requirements.

<div ><span >• If you have unstable angina (chest pain due 
<br>to low blood supply to the heart) and are 
<br>scheduled for an angioplasty operation, 
<br>your doctor will give you the bolus injection 
<br>up to 24 hours before the scheduled 
<br>operation. After the bolus injection your 
<br>doctor will start the infusion. The infusion will 
<br>continue for 12 hours after the operation is 
<br>completed.
<br></span><span >Dosage
<br></span><span >Your doctor will calculate the dose of ReoPro 
<br>to give to you as follows:
<br>• The dose of the bolus injection will be based 
<br>on your body weight. The dose is 
<br>0.25 milligrams for every kilogram of your 
<br>body weight.
<br>• The infusion dose will also be based on your 
<br>body weight. The dose is 0.125 micrograms 
<br>per kilogram per minute up to a maximum of 
<br>10 micrograms per minute.
<br></span><span >After the operation
<br></span><span >After the angioplasty operation your doctor or 
<br>nurse will gently press a dressing on the artery 
<br>to stop any bleeding. Total bed rest is required 
<br>by the patient and the leg on which the 
<br>angioplasty has been performed must be kept 
<br>in a straight position for at least 6 to 8 hours. 
<br>You will also be carefully observed by your 
<br>doctor and nurse and your blood pressure and 
<br>pulse will be measured several times. Regular 
<br>blood tests will also be performed to monitor 
<br>your blood cell count.
