3. <b>How to take Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets 
</b> <br><br><br>---------<br>
<b>Always take Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets exactly as 
your doctor has told you. The label on your medicine 
should also tell you. You should check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure.  
</b> <br><br>The usual adult dose of Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets is 0.5mg to 1.5mg. For patients with mild to moderate difficulties in breathing or patients with liver impairment a dose reduction should be considered. You should swallow your tablets with water just before you go to bed at night. Make sure you can have 7 or 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep before taking Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets.<br>---------<br>
<b>Elderly: </b>Elderly patients may respond to half the usual adult dose or less. The label on your medicine will tell you how many tablets to take and how often. If it does not, or you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.<br>---------<br>
Treatment usually lasts from a few days to 2 weeks. It should not usually last longer than 4 weeks including a dose reduction at the end. This reduces the risk of becoming dependant on Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets, or suffering unpleasant side-effects when you stop taking them (See ‘If you stop taking Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets' section).<br>---------<br>
The beneficial effect of Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets may be less apparent after several weeks of use. If you are given Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets for more than 4 weeks, your doctor might want to take blood samples occasionally to check your blood and liver, since drugs like Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets have occasionally affected liver function.<br>---------<br>
<b>If you take more Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets than 
you should 
</b><br>Do not take more tablets than stated on the label of your medicine. If you take too many tablets you should seek medical attention immediately, either by calling your doctor, or going to the nearest casualty department. Always take the labelled medicine container with you, even if there are no tablets left.<br><br>---------<br>
<b>If you forget to take Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets 
</b> <br>If you forget to take a dose, don't worry, just take your next tablet when it is due. <b>Do not take a double dose to make 
</b><br>---------<br>
<b>up for a forgotten tablet. 
</b> <br><br><b>If you stop taking Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets 
</b> <br>After you have finished your prescribed treatment with Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets, your doctor will decide if you need further treatment. The number of Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets and how often you take them should always be reduced slowly before stopping them. This allows your body to get used to being without your tablets, and reduces the risk of unpleasant effects when you stop taking them. Your doctor will tell you how to do this. On stopping Lormetazepam 1mg Tablets, you may experience symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, anxiety, tension, depression, restlessness, sweating, confusion or irritability. Your original sleeplessness may also return. If you suffer from any of these symptoms, ask your doctor for advice.<br>Do not stop taking your tablets suddenly. This could lead to more serious symptoms such as loss of the sense of reality, feeling unreal or detached from life and unable to feel emotion. Some patients have also experienced numbness or tingling of the arms or legs, tinnitus (ringing sounds in the ears), oversensitivity to light, sound and touch, uncontrolled or overactive movements, twitching, shaking, feeling sick, being sick, stomach upsets or stomach pain, loss of appetite, agitation, abnormally fast heartbeats, panic attacks, dizziness or feeling that you are about to fall, memory loss, hallucinations, feeling stiff and unable to move easily, feeling very warm, convulsions (sudden uncontrolled shaking or jerking of the body). Patients taking anti-depressants and patients with seizure disorders may be more likely to experience convulsions.<br><br>---------<br>
<br><br><br><br>If you suffer from any of these symptoms, ask your doctor for advice immediately.<br><br>---------<br>
